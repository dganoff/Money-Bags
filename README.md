#Budget App

[Demo Site] (http://dganoff.github.io/Money-Bags/)

Built with Angular JS and Zurb Foundation 4. Compiled with Grunt JS.

Manage your monthly budget by entering reoccurring expenses, one-time expenses by month and your monthly income. The app will tell you how much money you are projected to save for the whole year.

##TO DO:
1. Separate functionality into more modular chunks - currently the expensesCtrl holds too much functionality.
